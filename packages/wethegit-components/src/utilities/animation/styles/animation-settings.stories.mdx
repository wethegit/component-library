# Animation settings

Provides some handy CSS custom properties which can be included in your app-level, global stylesheet. Check out the source file for all of the available settings `/utilities/animation/styles/_animation-settings.scss`.

## --duration-factor

An integer which acts as a multiplier for animation durations. Defaults to `1`. This is useful for removing transition time if a user prefers reduced motion: set this to `0` in that case. The animation utility, [duration](/docs/utilities-animation-styles-animation-utilities--overview#duration), uses this in its duration calculation.

## Easing

A collection of root-level cubic-bezier curves, for use in your CSS animations.

```css
.myComponent {
  transition: transform 0.2s var(--ease-back-out);
}
```
