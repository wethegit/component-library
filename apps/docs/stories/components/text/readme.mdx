# Text

`<Text>` provides a componentized solution to typography styling in a project. It gives us a predictible API to work with for styling purposes, and it allows us to separate _semantic_ hierarchy from _visual_ hierarchy in our typography.

The component uses root-level CSS custom properties to handle concerns such as size, weight, and line-height. All of these settings are exposed via a separate stylesheet for easy adjustment on a per-project basis.

### Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add text
```

Then add the required typography styles to your global stylesheet:

```scss filename="global.scss"
@import "<path-to>/components/text/styles/typography.scss";
```
