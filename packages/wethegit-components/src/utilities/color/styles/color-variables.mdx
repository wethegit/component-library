# Color variables

## Usage

`@use` the variables within in a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css filename="utilities/your-component/your-component.module.scss"
@use "@local/utilities/color/styles/color-variables" as *;
```

## $color

**Important** to note that you shouldn't be using this variable directly unless you need to manimulate these values somehow. Most likely what you want is one of the utilities from [`color-utilities`](/docs/utilities-color-styles-color-utilities--overview).

Signature: `$color: (
  "black": #000,
  "white": #fff,
);`

The `$color` variable is a map of `color-name` to `hex` value. All the color in the palette will be used to generate the utility classes.
