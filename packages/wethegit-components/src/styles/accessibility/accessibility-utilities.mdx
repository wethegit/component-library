# Accessibility utilities

The accessibility utilities provide you with helpful Sass functions so you can handle focus and reduce motion states.

## Usage

`@use` the accessibility utils within in a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css
@use "@local/styles/accessibility/accessibility-utilities" as *;
```

## Functions

### focus-style

Signature: `focus-style()`

Returns a CSS `box-shadow` value with two shadows to create a focus style that works on both light and dark backgrounds.

#### Example

```scss
@use "@local/styles/accessibility/accessibility-utilities" as *;

.customComponent {
  @include focus-style();
}
```

### focus-style-reverse

Signature: `focus-style-reverse()`

Returns a CSS `box-shadow` value with two shadows to create a focus style that works on both light and dark backgrounds. The reverse version reverts the order of the shadows.

#### Example

```scss
@use "@local/styles/accessibility/accessibility-utilities" as *;

.customComponent {
  @include focus-style-reverse();
}
```

### reduced-motion

Signature: `reduced-motion()`

Handles the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and also makes sure that the styles are replicated inside the reduced motion class selector that is added to the html by the [@wethegit/react-hooks](https://wethegit.github.io/react-hooks/user-preferences-provider) library.

#### Example

```scss
@use "@local/styles/animation/animation-utilities" as *;

.customComponent {
  @include reduced-motion() {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```
