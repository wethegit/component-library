# Breakpoints

**Location:** `<alias-to>/styles/_settings-breakpoints.scss`

This file defines the breakpoints. A few components depend on this to ensure that they are responsive.

Feel free to change the values but **do not delete the variables**.

A lot of components will have props that accept a **breakpoint-object**. This object can be used to define the value for each breakpoint, and follows the following format:

```ts
type Breakpoints<T> = {
  sm?: T;
  md?: T;
  lg?: T;
  xl?: T;
  xxl?: T;
}
```

Where `T` is variable depending on the prop. For example, the `Row` component has the `align` prop which accepts a `Breakpoints<string>` object. This means that the `align` prop **breakpoints-object** is an object where each key is a breakpoint and the value is a string.

At the same time, the `Row` component also has the `wrap` prop which accepts a `Breakpoints<boolean>` object. This means that the `wrap` prop **breakpoints-object** is an object where each key is a breakpoint and the value is a boolean.

The keys of the breakpoints object are optional. If a breakpoint is not defined, the default value will be used.

Example usage with the `Row` component:
```jsx
<Row
  align={{
    md: 'flex-end',
    lg: 'space-between',
    xl: 'space-around'
    xxl: 'space-between'
  }}
  wrap={{
    md: true,
    lg: false,
    xl: true,
    xxl: false
  }}
/>
```
