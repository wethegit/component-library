# Animation presets

The animation presets allow you set up project-wide settings for your animations.

## Usage

`@use` the animation presets within in a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css
@use "@local/utilities/animation/styles/animation-presets" as *;
```

## Animation definitions

⚠️ If using TypeScript, Please ensure that any animations added to this list are also added to the avaialable list of animation keys within the `utilities/animation.ts` file.

Signature:

```
$animation: (
  "key": (
    "start-alpha": 0,
    "start-rotate": 0deg,
    "start-scale": 1,
    "start-x": 0,
    "start-y": 0,
    "end-alpha": 1,
    "end-rotate": 0deg,
    // etc.
  ),
  // etc.
);
```

The `$animation` variable is a SASS map of `animation-preset` keys to `transform` and `opacity` values. Each animation definition will generate a **CSS module** with the className corresponding to the `key` defined here. These will be available on the `animation` object within your JSX files.

### Example

```jsx
import { animation } from "@local/utilities/animation"

function Component() {
  return <div className={animation.scaleUp} />
}
```
