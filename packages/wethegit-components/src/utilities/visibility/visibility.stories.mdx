# Visibility

The visibility utility exposes an object that maps to a CSS module which generates breakpoint based visibility classes.

## Usage

A `div` that is hidden on `small` screens only:

```jsx
import { classnames, visibility } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return <div className={classnames([visibility.smOnly])} />
}
```

A `div` that is hidden on `small` and `medium` screens:

```jsx
import { classnames, visibility } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return <div className={classnames([visibility.lgUp])} />
}
```

## No JS

If you do not want to use the JS version of the visibility utility you can easily do so by:

1. Remove any imports of `visibility` from your code
2. Rename `visibility.module.scss` to `visibility.scss`
3. Import `visibility.scss` in your global styles

And then proceed to use the classes as you would normally do.

```html
<div class="text-black bg-white" />
```
