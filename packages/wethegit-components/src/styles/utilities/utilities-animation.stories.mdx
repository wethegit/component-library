# Animation utilities

The animation utilities provide you with helpful Sass functions for your custom CSS animations.

## Usage

`@use` the animation utilities within a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css
@use "@local/styles/utilities/utilities-animation" as *;
```

## Functions

### duration

Signature: `duration($cssDuration)`

`duration` Receives either a milliseconds or a seconds value, and returns the same value multiplied by the global `--duration-factor`. This is useful for removing animations when a user prefers reduced motion.

#### Example

```css
@use "@local/styles/utilities/utilities-animation" as *;

.customComponent {
  /*
   * If --duration-factor is 1, this will be 1 second.
   * If --duration-factor is 0, this will be 0 seconds.
   */
  transition: transform duration(1s);
}
```

ðŸ’¡ `duration()` also has an alias, `delay()`. They are both identical, functionally.
