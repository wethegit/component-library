# Colors

The colors utility exposes an object that maps to a CSS module which generates colors for background and text.

To change the colors you can simply [update](/docs/utilities-colors-styles-colors-utilities--docs) the `styles/_colors-utilities.scss`.

## Usage

A `p` with `white` color and `black` background:

```jsx
import { classnames, colors } from "@local/colors"

function Comp() {
  return <div className={classnames([colors.bg.black, colors.text.white])} />
}
```

### Styles and Sass

The utilities lack support for hover, focus and others states and also for alpha customization.

But for those use cases and for even further customization the colors utility expose a Sass function that can be used directly.

Read more about the function [here](/docs/utilities-colors-styles-colors-utilities--docs).

```css
@use "@local/utilities/colors/styles/colors-utilities" as *;

.my-class {
  background-color: get-color("black", 0.5);
}
```
