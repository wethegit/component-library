# Spacing variables

It's in this file that you define the spacing unit, which is used by the [function](/docs/utilities-spacing-styles-spacing-utilities--overview) to generate the spacing classes. By default, the spacing unit is `8px`.

## Usage

`@use` the helpers within in a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css filename="utilities/your-component/your-component.module.scss"
@use "@local/utilities/spacing/styles/spacing-variables" as *;
```

## $spacing-unit

Signature: `$spacing-unit: 8px !default;`

The spacing unit is used by the `space-by` function.
