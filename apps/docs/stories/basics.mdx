# Basics

There are some global dependencies that are important to be aware of.

## Reset

**Location:** `<alias-to>/styles/reset.scss`

We ship a very basic reset stylesheet. It's optional but **highly recommended**.

## Global styles

**Location:** `<alias-to>/styles/global.scss`

This file contains the global styles and it also imports the reset stylesheet by default.
