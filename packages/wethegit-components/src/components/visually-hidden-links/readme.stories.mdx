# VisuallyHiddenLinks

The intended use of this component is to provide a list of visually hidden links that help users who rely on screen-reader-assisted technologies to navigate landmarks on a page faster, removing the need to tab through large sections of content. The links themselves are only visible when focussed on.

This component is split into two items; `VisuallyHiddenLinks` and `VisuallyHiddenLinkItem`.

The `VisuallyHiddenLinks` component renders out a `ul`. The `VisuallyHiddenLinkItem` renders out a `li`, which wraps a `VisuallyHidden` component that accepts an `href`. `VisuallyHiddenLinkItem` allows for any children to be passed to it, giving the user an unrestricted experience when using the component.

## Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add visually-hidden-links
```

## Use-cases

A great example of when one might use `VisuallyHiddenLinks` would be to list out a set of navigatable landmarks at the start of a page. For instance; `skip to main content`, `skip to news` and `skip to footer`. This would essentially provide options for users to navigate to any of those sections without trolling through redundant content.
