# Animation utilities

The animation utilities provide you with helpful Sass functions for your custom CSS animations.

## Usage

`@use` the animation utils within in a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css
@use "@local/styles/utilities/utilities-animation" as *;
```

## Functions

### focus-style

Signature: `focus-style()`

Returns a CSS `box-shadow` value with two shadows to create a focus style that works on both light and dark backgrounds.

#### Example

```scss
@use "@local/styles/utilities/utilities-accessibility" as *;

.customComponent {
  @include focus-style();
}
```

### focus-style-reverse

Signature: `focus-style-reverse()`

Returns a CSS `box-shadow` value with two shadows to create a focus style that works on both light and dark backgrounds. The reverse version reverts the order of the shadows.

#### Example

```scss
@use "@local/styles/utilities/utilities-accessibility" as *;

.customComponent {
  @include focus-style-reverse();
}
```

### reduced-motion

Signature: `reduced-motion()`

Handles the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and also makes sure that the styles are replicated inside the reduced motion class selector that is added to the html by the [@wethegit/react-hooks](https://wethegit.github.io/react-hooks/user-preferences-provider) library.

#### Example

```scss
@use "@local/styles/utilities/utilities-animation" as *;

.customComponent {
  @include reduced-motion() {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```
