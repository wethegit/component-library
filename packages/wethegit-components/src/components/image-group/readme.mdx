`<ImageGroup>` facilitates the creation of responsive image compositions (though it's not limited to images). It works by first establishing an aspect ratio on a parent element, and then positioning child elements within the shape, relative to its dimensions.

## Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add image-group
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { ImageGroup, ImageGroupItem } from "@local/components/image-group"
...

<ImageGroup className="fruitGroup">
  <ImageGroupItem className="apple">
    <img src="apple.png" alt="A succulent, red apple." />
  </ImageGroupItem>

  <ImageGroupItem className="orange">
    <img src="orange.png" alt="A rotting, brown orange." />
  </ImageGroupItem>
</ImageGroup>
```

```css
.fruitGroup {
  /*
    These two unitless pixel values establish the aspect ratio
    as well as a baseline size to position children relative to.
    Thus, these numbers do not necessarily affect the
    rendered width and height of your element.
  */
  --parent-height: 268;
  --parent-width: 400;
}

.apple {
  /*
    These unitless pixel values are relative to the parent group.
    This will be positioned and sized using _percentages_ of the parent,
    giving you full responsiveness no matter the size of the parent.
  */
  --left: 34;
  --top: 100;
  --width: 67;
}

.orange {
  --left: 34;
  --top: 100;
  --width: 67;
}
```

## How it works

`<ImageGroup>` eases the burden of creating responsive lockups consisting of *multiple* different images or elements. The main idea here is to measure the assets of your design file, and plug the numbers directly into the `<ImageGroup>` and `<ImageGroupItem>` CSS custom properties.

### What problem does it solve?

Let's pretend we have been given the following design, where each of the four elements need to animate in—separately from one another—and be crawlable by screen readers. These two requirements mean the images *have* to be separated, and cannot be a single unit. This potentially introduces responsiveness headaches (how do we handle positioning when a user resizes their browser?). This is the problem that image group solves. We can ensure that the group scales up and down as a whole, by using `<ImageGroup>`.

<img src="/image-group-demo/image-group-demo.jpg" alt="Example design." style={{ maxInlineSize: "300px" }} />

### Measuring your design

The following video is a good reference for the example workflow we'll walk through in this section.

<video src="/image-group-demo/image-group-demo.mp4" style={{ maxInlineSize: "500px" }} controls />

You'll start by plugging your "wrapper shape" dimensions into the two CSS custom properties on the `<ImageGroup>` component. In the case of the example design from before, those will be `300` and `300`. These must be **unitless** values. This will establish the aspect ratio for the group itself. In this case, the width and height are the same, so it will be a simple square.

```css
.your-group {
  --parent-height: 300;
  --parent-width: 300;
}
```

The next step is to measure your individual elements, and get their `left` and `top` positions relative to the parent element (again, in unitless pixel values). You'll also grab the width, in unitless pixel values. All three of these values will be plugged into the CSS custom properties for each of your `<ImageGroupItem>` components. Looking specifically at the green triangle image here, we can see that it is 100px wide, 100px from the left, and 200px from the top.

```css
.triangle-item {
  --left: 100;
  --top: 200;
  --width: 100;
}
```

Follow this step for each of the items in your group, and you'll end up with a responsive image composition. It's important to understand that the actual numbers are not what get rendered — they simply establish the percentage relationships between parent and child.
