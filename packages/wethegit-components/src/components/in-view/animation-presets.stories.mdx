# Animation presets

The animation presets allow you create presets for your `<InView>` animations.

## Animation definitions

The `<InView>` component's animation definitions are set up as a Sass variable which you can customize as needed.

⚠️ If using TypeScript, Please ensure that any animations added to this list are also added to the avaialable list of animation keys within the `./in-view/components/in-view-item/animation/animation.ts` file.

Signature:

```
$animation: (
  "key": (
    "start-alpha": 0,
    "start-rotate": 0deg,
    "start-scale": 1,
    "start-x": 0,
    "start-y": 0,
    "end-alpha": 1,
    "end-rotate": 0deg,
    "end-scale": 1,
    "end-x": 0,
    "end-y": 0,
  ),
  // etc.
);
```

The `$animation` variable is a SASS map of `animation-preset` keys to `transform` and `opacity` values. Each animation definition will generate a **CSS module** with the className corresponding to the `key` defined here. These will be available on the `animation` object within your JSX files.

### Example

Using the `scaleUp` preset with the `<InViewItem>` component:

```jsx
import { InView, InViewItem, animation } from "@local/components/in-view"

function Component() {
  return (
    <InView>
      <InViewItem animation={animation.scaleUp}>Watch me scale!</InViewItem>
    </InView>
  )
}
```
