# grid-layout

The grid-layout component is the foundation of the grid system. It is used to create a grid container and its columns.

### Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add grid-layout
```

After that, add the grid required styles to your global styles:

```scss filename="global.scss"
@import "<path-to>/components/grid-layout/styles/grid-layout.scss";
```

### Customize

To customize the grid, you can override the variables inside the `grid-layout.scss` file.

For more information about the variables, check the [grid layout styles docs](/docs/components-grid-layout-styles-grid-layout--docs).
