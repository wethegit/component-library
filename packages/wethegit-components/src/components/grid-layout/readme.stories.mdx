# grid-layout

The grid-layout component is the foundation of the grid system. It is used to create a grid container and its columns.

One thing that's important to note is that the none of the **breakpoint-object** properties will accept the `sm` breakpoint. This is because the grid-layout component will span the full width of the viewport on the `sm` breakpoint.

### Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add grid-layout
```

After that, add the grid required styles to your global styles:

```scss filename="global.scss"
@import "<path-to>/components/grid-layout/styles/grid-layout.scss";
```
