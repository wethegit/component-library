# VisuallyHidden

The `VisuallyHidden` component provides a mechanism for hiding content from sighted users, but keeping that same content exposed to users of screen-reader assistive technologies. This has a number of use-cases, but the most common are:

- [Providing context](#providing-more-context-to-an-ambiguous-call-to-action)
- [Hiding an element until it's focused](#hiding-an-element-until-its-focused)

## Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add visually-hidden
```

## Use-cases
### Providing more context to an ambiguous call-to-action

Users of assistive technologies have the option to navigate a page by traversing its links, so seeing `"Learn more"` ten times on a page can be disorienting when these links all go to different places. It's best to use text that provides context in the first place, but sometimes we need to remedy the situation with visually-hidden text to accompany the visual CTA. As an example, a sighted user might see a link which reads "Learn more"; but the screen-reader user will hear "Learn more about the gameplay mechanics".

### Hiding an element until it's focused

A good example of this is a "Skip to content" link. The community-established convention is to visually-hide links like this at the top of a page, and show them only once a user shifts their focus to them (with the `tab` key, or via a screen-reader, for example).
