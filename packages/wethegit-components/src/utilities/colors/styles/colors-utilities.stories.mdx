# Colors utilities

The color utility also comes with a Sass function that can be used to get any color from the palette with variable opacity.

It's in this file that you also define the color palette.

## Usage

`@use` the helpers within in a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css filename="utilities/your-component/your-component.module.scss"
@use "@local/utilities/colors/styles/colors-utilities" as *;
```

## get-color

Signature: `get-color($color-name, $opacity: 1)`

`get-color` Receives a `string` and optionaly a `float`, and returns an `rgba` value.

### Example

```css
.customComponent {
  background-color: get-color("black", 0.5); /* 50% opacity black */
}
```

## $colors

Signature: `$colors: (
  "black": #000,
  "white": #fff,
);`

The `$colors` variable is a map of `color-name` to `hex` value. All the colors in the palette will be used to generate the utility classes.
