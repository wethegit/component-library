# Spacing

The spacing utility exposes a set of classes that can be used to add margin and padding to elements.

By default it's based on a `8px` grid but can be configured to use any value by simply changing the `$spacing-unit` variable inside `styles/_spacing-utilities.scss`.

So for example if you wanted `16px` of margin you would simply use `spacing.margin[2]`.

## Usage

A `div` with `16px` of margin on all sides and `24px` of padding on all sides:

```jsx
import { classnames, spacing } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return <div className={classnames([spacing.margin[2], spacing.padding[3]])} />
}
```

A `div` that is centered with `16px` of padding on `left` and `right`:

```jsx
import { classnames, spacing } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return <div className={classnames([spacing.margin.x.auto, spacing.padding.x[2]])} />
}
```

A `div` with `16px` margin on the `top`, `8px` on the `right`, `24px` on the `bottom` and `32px` on the `left`:

```jsx
import { classnames, spacing } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return (
    <div
      className={classnames([
        spacing.margin.top[2],
        spacing.margin.right[1],
        spacing.margin.bottom[3],
        spacing.margin.left[4],
      ])}
    />
  )
}
```

### Child spacing

The spacing utility allows you to easily establish a consistent _vertical_ flow for the child elements of a given container. This is a useful alternative to adding `spacing.margin.top[2]` to every child element.

It's important to mention the distinction between "child spacing" and the other spacing utilities (`padding` and `margin`): "child-spacing" is only for vertical spacing of immediate children. A good use case for this is separating typographic elements vertically, like a heading followed by a few paragraphs.

Here is an unordered list which adds `16px` of vertical space between all immediate child nodes:

```jsx
import { classnames, spacing } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return (
    <ul className={spacing.children[2]}>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 1</li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

This uses the CSS selector `> * + *` behind the scenes, adding `margin-top` to every _subsequent_ child of an element (ommitting the first child).

## Responsiveness

The spacing utility also has responsive classes that can be used to add margin and padding at different breakpoints.

So for example if you wanted `16px` of margin on all sides at `sm` but `24px` on `md` and up you would simply use `spacing.margin[2]` and `spacing.md.margin[3]`.

```jsx
import { classnames, spacing } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return <div className={classnames([spacing.margin[2], spacing.md.margin[3]])} />
}
```

Similarly, you could apply the following for spacing-out all immediate children of an element:

```jsx
import { classnames, spacing } from "@local/utilities"

function Comp() {
  return <div className={classnames([spacing.children[2], spacing.md.children[3]])} />
}
```

### Styles and Sass

You can also use the Sass function `space-by()` to get the value of a spacing unit.
Read more about the function [here](/docs/utilities-spacing-styles-spacing-utilities--overview).

```css
@use "@local/utilities/spacing/styles/spacing-utilities" as *;

.my-class {
  margin: space-by(2);
}
```

## No JS

If you do not want to use the JS version of the spacing utility you can easily do so by:

1. Remove any imports of `spacing` from your code
2. Rename `spacing.module.scss` to `spacing.scss`
3. Import `spacing.scss` in your global styles

And then proceed to use the classes as you would normally do.

```html
<div class="margin-top-2 padding-x-3" />
```

The biggest difference from the CSS classes to the JS classes is that in the JS classes the **breakpoint comes first**:

```jsx
<div className={spacing.large.margin.right[2]} />
```

```html
<div class="margin-right-large-2" />
```
