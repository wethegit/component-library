# Accordion

`<Accordion>` provides a componentized solution to adding an accordion to your project.

## Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add accordion
```

Then add the required styles to your global stylesheet:

```css filename="global.scss"
@import "<path-to>/components/accordion/styles/accordion";
```

## Usage example

```jsx
import { Accordion } from "@local/components/accordion"

function YourComponent() {
  return <Accordion>
}
```

## Accessibility

### Reduced motion

This component leverages the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` css media feature to dynamically change the duration of the open/close effect, based on whether the user has the reduced motion preference enabled on their system. If they do, the expand/collapse happens instanly rather than being tweened.

## Customize

To customize the accordion styles, you can override the variables inside the `accordion.module.scss` file.
