# Navigation

In it's basic form, the `<Navigation>` component is a hamburger menu that opens a list of links on the `sm` breakpoint and from the `md` breakpoint and up, it's a horizontal list of links that is sticky to the top of the viewport.

It also takes care of trapping the focus within the navigation when it's open on mobile.

## Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add navigation
```

## Navigation items

The `Navigation` is designed so handling the links is completely open to the developer. The only requirement is that the direct children of the `Navigation` are `NavListItem` components.

```tsx
<Navigation aria-label="Main Navigation">
  <NavListItem>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
  </NavListItem>
  <NavListItem>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
  </NavListItem>
</Navigation>
```

## Customizing

The `<Navigation>` component is split into 3 main components:

- `<Toggler>`: The hamburger menu that opens the navigation on mobile.
- `<Overlay>`: The overlay that covers the viewport when the navigation is open on mobile. This can be simply removed if you don't intend on having a full screen overlay.
- `<NavList>`: The list of links that is shown on mobile and desktop.

One other minor components that is part of the `<Navigation>` component is:

- `<NavListItem>`: The list item that wraps each link.

Each of these components come with very simple and crude styles to just make things work. Customize them to your liking.
