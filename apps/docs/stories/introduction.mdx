# Component Library

Minally styled, accessible, React component primitives that can be copy and pasted into your project.

### Philosophy

At We The Collective our projects are always visually drastically different. Having a design system with a fixed API and styles doesn't make sense.

These components are designed to be a foundation to be extended upon based on your project's requirements. They are meant to speed up work and provide easy of mind knowing that they are accessible and tested.

To extend that even further this library is developed so that components are copied into your project instead of being imported from a package.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have **Node.js v18+** installed.

Install:

```bash
npm install -D @wethegit/components-cli
```

Initialize the project, this step will create the required directories and install the mandatory dependencies.

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli init
```

After initializing, the global styles will be copied to the specified directory. Make sure you import them in your project.

## Adding components

Add components to your project by running the following command:

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add
```

You can also adds components by providing the name as an argument:

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add grid-layout flex ...etc
```

The copied files use an alias named `@local/` to import other local files.

It also assumes the following as paths to local directories:

1. `@local/components`
2. `@local/styles`
3. `@local/utilities`

Your project must have these setup _OR_ you can simply do a find/replace and change it.

We are working on a way to make this more flexible.
