# Navigation

In it's basic form, the `<Navigation>` component is a hamburger menu that opens a list of links on the `sm` breakpoint and from the `md` breakpoint and up, it's a horizontal list of links that is sticky to the top of the viewport.

It also takes care of trapping the focus within the navigation when it's open on mobile.

## Install

```bash
npx @wethegit/components-cli add navigation
```

## Navigation items

Inside the `navigation.tsx` file, you'll find a `LINKS` object. This is where you can edit your navigation items.

```tsx
const LINKS = {
  home: {
    label: "Home",
    href: "/",
  },
}
```

Highlighting the current page is done by passing a one of the **keys** from the `LINKS` object to the `currentPage` prop on the `<Navigation>` component.

```tsx
<Navigation currentPage="home" />
```

## Customizing

The `<Navigation>` component is split into 3 main components:

- `<Toggler>`: The hamburger menu that opens the navigation on mobile.
- `<Overlay>`: The overlay that covers the viewport when the navigation is open on mobile. This can be simply removed if you don't intend on having a full screen overlay.
- `<NavList>`: The list of links that is shown on mobile and desktop.

One other minor components that is part of the `<Navigation>` component is:

- `<NavListItem>`: The list item that wraps each link.

Each of these components come with very simple and crude styles to just make things work. Customize them to your liking.
