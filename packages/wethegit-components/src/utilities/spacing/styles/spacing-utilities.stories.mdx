# Spacing utilities

The spacing utility also comes with a Sass function that can be used to get the value of a spacing unit.

It's in this file that you also define the spacing unit, which is used by the function. By default, the spacing unit is `8px`.

## Usage

`@use` the helpers within in a `.scss` stylesheet:

```css filename="utilities/your-component/your-component.module.scss"
@use "@local/utilities/spacing/styles/spacing-utilities" as *;
```

## space-by

Signature: `space-by($multiplier)`

`space-by` Receives a number, and returns a spacing unit multiplied by that number.

### Example

```css
.customComponent {
  margin-right: space-by(6); // 6 * 8px = 48px
}
```

## $spacing-unit

Signature: `$spacing-unit: 8px !default;`

The spacing unit is used by the `space-by` function.
